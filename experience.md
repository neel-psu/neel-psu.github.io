# Current work

## Penn State (Aug, 2023 - Present)
_Graduate student_

Busy with course work.
<!--
• _Role_: Use the Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the turbulent coefficient of a flow and use a finite element solver (Fenics) to evaluate the ground truth.  

• _Sponsoring Agency_: Argonne National Lab (ANL)

# Previous experience

## École Centrale School of Engineering [Mahindra University] (July 2022 - June, 2023) 

**Development of a framework for Turbulence modelling using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**  
_Junior Researcher_

• _Role_: Address the Spectral Bias in turbulence modeling and implement the modulus or open‑source approach to resolve the Kolmogorov scale using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Furthermore, it aims to resolve shocks (which is still fertile ground).  

• _Sponsoring Agency_: Aeronautical Research and Development Board (ARDB).

## Indian Institutes of Technology, Kharagpur (Oct, 2021 - July, 2022)

**Development of a Hybrid Continuum to Atomistic Scale Solver for Multi‑scale Flow Problems**  
_Junior Research Fellow_

•_Role_: Implement the Deep Learning based solution of Poisson’s equation into Multi‑scale Flow solver.  

• _Report URL_: [Poisson CNN](/assets/pdfs/Poisson_CNN_usage.pdf)  

• _Sponsoring Agency_: National Supercomputing Mission (NSM).  

• _Supporting Agency_: **NVIDIA**.


## Indian Institutes of Technology, Bombay (April, 2021 - Oct, 2021)

**Prediction of Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Atmospheric Optical Turbulence using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**  
_Research Assistant_

• _Role_: Understand the usage of Meso‑NH (Fortran) and PyCLES (Python) framework.  

• _Sponsoring Agency_: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
