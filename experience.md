## Current work

## Penn State (Aug, 2023 - Present)
_Graduate student_

• Role: Use the Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the turbulent coefficient of a flow and use a finite element solver (Fenics) to evaluate the ground truth.  

• Sponsoring Agency: Argonne National Lab (ANL)

# Previous experience

## École Centrale School of Engineering [Mahindra University] (July 2022 - June, 2023) 

**Development of a framework for Turbulence modelling using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
_Junior Researcher_

• Role: Address the Spectral Bias in turbulence modeling and implement the modulus or open‑source approach to resolve the Kolmogorov scale using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Furthermore, it aims to resolve shocks (which is still fertile ground).  

• Sponsoring Agency: Aeronautical Research and Development Board (ARDB).

## Indian Institutes of Technology, Kharagpur (Oct, 2021 - July, 2022)

**Development of a Hybrid Continuum to Atomistic Scale Solver for Multi‑scale Flow Problems**
_Junior Research Fellow_

• Role: Implement the Deep Learning based solution of Poisson’s equation into Multi‑scale Flow solver.  

• Report URL: [Poisson CNN](/assets/pdfs/Poisson_CNN_usage.pdf)  

• Sponsoring Agency: National Supercomputing Mission (NSM).  

• Supporting Agency: NVIDIA.


## Indian Institutes of Technology, Bombay (April, 2021 - Oct, 2021)

**Prediction of Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Atmospheric Optical Turbulence using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**
_Research Assistant_

• Role: Understand the usage of Meso‑NH (Fortran) and PyCLES (Python) framework.  

• Sponsoring Agency: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
